## About Me

I am currently a research assistant professor in the [BTM](https://biomedirobotics.com/) group, Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, directed by [Prof. Kwok Wai Samuel Au](https://www4.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/au-kwok-wai-samuel/). 
I was a postdoctoral fellow in [Multi-scale Medical Robotics Center](https://www.mrc-cuhk.com/). Prior to my PhD study, I received B.E. and M.E. degrees at Harbin Institute of Technology, China. In the third year, I was visiting the group of [Prof. Hartmut Geyer](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hgeyer/) at Carnegie Mellon University, USA. Besides, I was visiting the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures & Augmented Reality [(CAMP)](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/), supervised by [Prof. Nassir Navab](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/navab-nassir), at Technical University of Munich, Germany, from July 2023 to Jan 2024.

My research interests include 1) Developments of robotic surgical and medical systems and related algorithms; 2) Developments of nuanced manipulation skills on (deformable) objects and their applications in surgery and service; 3) Developments of agile locomotion systems and related algorithms / their applications on biomechanics.

**1. Opportunities are available for postdoctoral fellows in medical robotics with a focus on image-guided surgical intervention systems.**

**2. The summer research application is open now.**

**3. CUHK students (undergraduate and MSc) interested in research are welcome to contact me via email to explore potential opportunities.**
